I got my inspiration from looking up portfolio sites, sites that use mininmal, uncluttered backgrounds, with few nav buttons. In fact, this particular template mimicks Google's main landing page. Using the wireframe tools sites is pretty easy, although they can be cumbersome when it comes to not having all the features available in the free versions. For example, to save a wireframe as a pdf, there are a few steps involved, even one site requires that you're a member to be able to save files as pdfs. All in all, the tools offered are easy to use.
